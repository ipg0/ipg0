# About me
I am a full stack web developer/DevOps engineer, 21, from Moscow, Russia. I know a lot of programming languages.

Also, my live stats have fucked off, so here's some useless info instead.

Currently I work primarily in JavaScript and TypeScript.

Every programming language is a mistake, except, probably, Haskell. I love Haskell.
